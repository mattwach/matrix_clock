> "I DONâ€™T EVEN SEE THE CODE ANYMORE" - The Matrix.  

![matrix clock](images/matrix_clock.jpg)

This is a clock that presents in a matrix-like format on an 8x8 RGB LED matrix.  At first you will not be able to read it but eventually the patterns will become clear.

But, given that this is an open DIY project that combines some code with an LED matrix and clock, you can mold it to include your own ideas.  It's a starting point for the clock that
you want to make.  For example maybe you want:

   * To use a different LED matrix (Different dimensions, neopixel, other types)
   * To use a different type of clock hardware (Radio based, GPS, internet, none)
   * To display the data differently (Scrolling numbers, binary clock etc).

   This project attempts to make it straight-forward to make changes like the ones described above, both in the way the code is structured and in the advice I give later in this document on how to make these types of changes in the code.

# Parts List

Here are the parts I used to build my version:

   * Microcontroller: Raspberry PI Pico
   * LED Matrix: Adafruit Dotstart 8x8
   * Clock: DS3231-based RTC module
   * Buttons: 2 12x12 pushbuttons for control, 1 6x3 SMD reset button (optional)
   * Connector: 1 4x1 JST-XR male-female pair for connecting the LED matrix
   * 1 220uF capacitor to reduce 5V noise
   * A 6x4 cm copper clad board. Only needed if you CNC or chemical etch your PCB.

# Reading the clock

Here is my scheme for showing the time.  You can change it as-you-like to create a clock that only you can read :)

Numbers are represented by colors.  At the time of writing there were as follows:

> Colors are defined in [src/colors.c](src/colors.c) if you would like to edit them.

As for digits, this is represented by the speed at which the matrix points fall:

| digit               | speed  |
|---------------------|--------|
| Hour - ones place   | slow   |
| Minute - tens place | medium |
| Minute - ones place | fast   |

So given the above, here is a table of examples:

| 12h time | 24h time | Slow point | Medium Point | Fast Point |
|----------|----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 12:00 AM | 00:00    | brown      | brown        | brown      |
| 12:15 AM | 00:15    | brown      | red          | blue       |
| 1:37 PM  | 13:37    | yellow     | yellow       | magenta    |
| 11:37 PM | 23:37    | yellow     | yellow       | magenta    |


If you are wondering about the hour's tens place, the clock doesn't show it.  I thought it made the clock easier to read but you'll have
to know if it's morning our evening to fill in the tens yourself.

Read the next section for various "training" modes the clock offers to help you learn to read it.

# Feature Overview

This is a quick tour of the built in-features

## Power On

When you first plug in the board you will get a matrix clock display that indicates the current time as-reported by the connected clock module.

## Setting the Time

The clock has two buttons named "set" and "increment".

   * If you press the set button once, the clock will show the current hours.  You can use the "increment" button to change the hour.
   * If you press the set button again, the clock will show the current minutes.  You can use the "increment" button to change the minute.
   * If you press the set button a third time, the clock will return to showing the matrix display

## Changing the Display Mode

If you press the "increment" button while the matrix is showing, the clock will
cycle through display modes.  Currently defined modes include:

* Matrix mode (the default) Time scroll mode, similar to matrix mode but uses
* numbers so it's easier to read Time fade mdoe.  Uses bigger numbers so even
* easier to read Binary clock mode.  Uses binary symbols in place of digits.
* Unfortunately my case diffuses the pixels too much for this mode to work well,
* but it could work well with alternate case designs.  Off.  Useful if you want
* a darkened room.

## Console Configuration

If you plug the clock into a computer, you can run a terminal emulator program to see and change more settings.  In Linux, I use the "minicom" terminal emulator and my command looks like this:

```bash
minicom -b 115200 -P /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Your device (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) may be different on your machine.  By default,
minicom turns on local echo, making my typed character appear twice.  I turn it
off with `ctrl-a e`, but your terminal emulator might be different.

Once started, youi will see something like this:

Type `help` or `?` for help.  Basic options include:

   * Changing LED brightness
   * Changing the time
   * Setting a sleep/wake time where the clock LEDs will automatically turn off.
