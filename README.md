![matrix clock](images/matrix_clock.jpg)

Shown above is a clock that presents the current time on an 64x32 RGB LED
matrix.  The clock has other selectable modes, including a view that omits the numbers:

![matrix clock](images/matrix_only.jpg)

and some other selectable views:

![matrix clock](images/other_matrix_modes.jpg)

Although the images above give you a basic idea, they can't show you the
dynamic range of the LED or the graphical effect of the 200 FPS animations,
I guess you'll just have to build one to see it yourself.

In terms of hardware the project's firmware is setup to support other hardware
configurations.  Included is a 8x8 dotstar matrix version that was my "V1":

![matrix clock](images/ds8x8/matrix_clock.jpg)

This document focuses on the newer 62x32-based model, which I prefer.  If you
want to learn more details on the 8x8 build, I have a separate document
for it [here](README_dotstar_8x8.md).

In the upcoming sections, I explain how I built the clock.  I also
explain how to modify the design in different ways.

# Parts List

Here are the parts I used.  You can of course modify the design to use
different ones.  Prices are "at time of writing":

   * Microcontroller: [Raspberry PI Pico ($4)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4864)
   * [LED Matrix 62x32: ($30)](https://www.amazon.com/waveshare-Displaying-Animation-Adjustable-Brightness/dp/B0B3W1PFY6)
     Note there are many variants available.
   * Clock: [DS3231-based RTC module ($4)](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-AT24C32-Arduino-Without-Battery/dp/B00LX3V7F0).
     Thi is optional-but-recommended - the firmware can be built to use the
     Pi Pico clock libraries but you will lose battery backup and the time
     will drift more. 
   * Buttons: I used [2 6mm pushbuttons for control (<$1)](https://www.amazon.com/WOWOONE-12x12x7-3-Tactile-Momentary-Assortment/dp/B08JLWTQ3C)
     and one 6x3 SMD button for optional reset capability.
   * Connectors:
     * I used one 8x2 2.54 pitch male pin header to interface the Pico PCB with the
       matrix (using the usually-included interface cable)
     * I used a 2x1 angled 2.54 pitch pin header for connecting the LED to the PCB.
     * I used a 3x1 angled 2.54 picth pin header for connectinf the buttons to the PCB
   * I used a 220uF capacitor to reduce 5V noise.  Somewhat larger or smaller values
     values should also work fine.
   * PCB for assembly.
     * There are many build options.  I ended up ordering a PCB from
       http://oshpark.com for the main board because my PCB layout needs a two-layer board.  I could have wired it up on perf board, but the large number of
       pin connections would have make it difficult to get a clean result.
     * There is a separate PCB for the buttons.  This board is very simple so
       any build technique should be straight-forward.  I used my CNC
       machine to cut a board within an hour.  If you order a main board, you
       might opt to bundle the button pcb with the order. 

Optional:

The LED display can pull over 3A if all LEDs are set to white.  The firmware
I wrote never does this and need about 100-300 mA for most of the modes as-measured.
Thus I'm using the Pi Picos VDD pin, which is directly connected to USB power.
This connection should be limited to 500 mA or less, thus I added the following to
enforce the current limit:

   * NCP380
   * Two additional 1uf capacitors for stability.  I am using SMD but ceramic
     through-hole are also an option.

My hardware has this current protection but it has never activated outside of
testing thus one might argue that it's not needed, but again, it's definitely
*possible* to change the firmware to pull > 500 mA.

# Reading the clock

Here is my scheme for showing the time, which you can easily modify to your
preference.

Numbers are represented by colors.  At the time of writing, they are as follows:

![numbers](images/clock_set.jpg)

> Colors are defined in [src/colors.c](src/colors.c) if you would like to edit them.

Different display modes use these colors in different ways.  For example, the
"matrix" display modes, moves points for hours and minutes as different speeds
and chooses colors based on the current time.  Thus it's possible to read the
clock with no numbers displayed at all if you spend enough time to learn what
the colors and speeds are telling you.

# Feature Overview

This is a quick tour of the built in-features

## Power On

When you plug in the clock via any USB power source you will get a matrix clock
display that indicates the current time as-reported by the RTC clock hardware.

![matrix clock 2](images/matrix_with_numbers.jpg)

## Setting the Time

The clock has two buttons on it's side: "set" and "increment". Pressing "set"
goes into time change mode where you can use "set" and "increment" to change
each time digit.

> You can also set the clock via the USB connection.

## Changing the Display Mode

If you press the "increment" button while the matrix is showing, the clock will
cycle through display modes.  Currently defined modes include:

* **Matrix With Numbers** The default
* **Matrix Only** For those who want a challenge
* **Bounce** Particles bounce around the numbers. 
* **Number Cascade** Digits fall from the top of the display to the bottom.  The size and speed of the digit represent the place in the time (hours vs minutes).
* **Waveform** Waveforms progress from the bottom of the display to the top at different speeds based on the time digit.
* **Drops** A water droplet effect appears behind the numbers.
* **Off -**  Useful if you want a darkened room.

Each display mode uses color as described earlier to accent the current time.

## Console Configuration

If you plug the clock into a computer, you can run a terminal emulator program
to access many additional settings.  In Linux, I use the "minicom" terminal
emulator and my command looks like this:

```bash
minicom -b 115200 -P /dev/ttyUSB0
```

> The serial device (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) can vary between computers and operating
> systems. 

Once started, you will see something like this:

![minicom](images/minicom.jpg)

> By default, `minicom` turns on local echo, making my typed characters appear
> twice.  `minicom` allows this to be turned off with `ctrl-a e`.

Type `help` or `?` for help.  Basic options include:

   * Changing LED brightness
   * Changing the time
   * Changing the poweron display mode
   * Simulating hardware button presses
   * Setting a sleep/wake time where the clock LEDs will automatically turn off.

# Build Instructions

## Electronics

Here is the schematic for the 64x32 (rotated) version:

![schematic](images/schematic.png)

Here is a description on major components and their purpose:

  - Pi Pico: This is the main controller
  - RTC Clock (Optional): This provides time to the Pico via an I2C connection.  You
    could use alternate clock hardware as described in a later section.  In terms of the I2C connection, note that the
    RTC clock is powered by 3.3V instead of the specified 5V.  This is the
    easiest way to make the clock compatible with the 3.3V maximum voltage of
    the PI Pico.  If your RTC really does need 5V, there are solutions but the
    details are not the focus of this document.  Thus I suggest doing a Google
    search for "3.3 to 5V I2C" to learn more.
  - 64x32 matrix: This is also a 5V part and is connected to the 5V VDD of the Pico,
    allowing ~500mA to be safely consumed by the panel.  The Pico is directly connected
    and will deliver 0-3.3V *signals* to the panel.  Unlike I2C for the RTC clock, the LED pins are high impedance inputs with no pullup thus there is no hardware risk in connecting them directly to the Pico.  The main risk is that the LED panel will not accept 3.3V as a legitimate "high" signal and thus it wont work.  For my panel
    3.3V was accepted without a problem thus no level converters were needed.
    I suspect this is the common scenerio with these panels.
  - 100 uF-470 uF capacitor.  The actual value is not important other that "big".  The
    purpose of the capacitor is to support the power requirements of the LED, which
    can be a "noisy" load, needing near zero current one moment and several hundred
    mA the next.
  - Support for buttons.  Select, increment and reset as described earlier.
  - NCP380 current limiting chip (optional).  This chip provides insurance for
    the case where you one day decide to change the firmware to light up many
    LEDs and draw too much current.  If you really want to do support high
    current draw, you'll need to rework the power design so that the LED panel
    can be directly powered from a capable (3A+) source instead of VDD on the
    Pico.
    
> VDD on the Pico is a direct passthrough to the USB power so it's the
> USB regulator (wall adapter, computer) and the PCB traces of the Pico that are
> the main power bottlenecks.

> If you don't us use the NCP380, simply connect the 5V directly to the LED.
> Keep the 100u capacitor for noise purposes.

## Firmware

> TLDR: If you don't want to build the firmware (`matrix_clock_led_64x32.uf2`) 
yourself, I have a couple of precompiled versions under the
[firmware](firmware) directory.

Source files (written in C) are  provided in the [src/](src) directory.  If you
have never built PI Pico firmware before, run through the official [Getting
started with the Raspberry Pi
PICO](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)
documentation first to get the needed tools up-and-running on your system.

The instructions for building the clock firmware are the same as the guide
linked above, but I created a small/simple [bootstrap.sh](src/bootstrap.sh)
script to lessen the number to needed steps:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh 
cd build/
make -j
```

I encourage you to view the contents of [bootstrap.sh](src/bootstrap.sh)
  yourself instead of blindly running it.  You'll see something like this:

```bash
$ cat bootstrap.sh 
#!/bin/bash

if [ ! -f pico_uart_console/CMakeLists.txt ]; then
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
fi

rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

> If building under Windows, you may opt to run the DOS-equivalent commands
> contained within `bootstrap.sh` manually.  The good news is that there
> are only a few commands to run.

The two major things done here are getting some dependencies (submodules) and
setting up a new build environment under `build/`

If all went well above, you will have a `src/build/matrix_clock.uf2` file available
to load onto a PI Pico.  Note that `firmware/matrix_clock_led_64x32.uf2` will
not be changed.

# Hardware build

The hardware build is fairly minimalistic, solving the given problems:

  * Securing the PI Pico, RTC hardware and buttons at the bottom of the panel
  * Keeping the connection cables constrained so the clock can mount flat on a wall
  * Providing a wall mount

I solved all of these problem by creating a couple of 3D models and printing them out.
I used OpenSCAD for the modeling.

This model is located at [case/led_matrix_64x32/led_matrix_64x32.scad](case/led_matrix_64x32/led_matrix_64x32.scad).
If can be changed with any text editor and viewed in the free [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org) software.

If you don't want to mess around with OpenSCAD, I also have the models available for
direct download at [case/led_matrix_64x32/export](case/led_matrix_64x32/export).  These
are .3mf files (the successor to .stl format) that most modern slicer programs can directly load.

![openscad_bottom](images/openscad_bottom.png)
![openscad_top](images/openscad_top.png)
![openscad_model](images/openscad_model.png)

To assemble, I used M2 bolts to attach the buttons to the bottom, 6mm long I
think but something in that area should be fine.  I used M3 bolts (around 12-16mm)
to attach the 3D printed parts to the led matrix.

The PCB settles into a custom slot in the bottom 3d part (see the grooves in the
red image above) and is held in place with no bolts required, just make sure
it's in the proper position before tightening the bolts.

The hex matrixes on the back hold the power and led interface cables within the unit so that it will mount flush on
the wall.  A guide and slot is provided for wall hanging the unit.

# Cusomization Guide

This part of the documentation points you in the right direction if you want to modify the project.

## Using Different LED Hardware

The file [src/led_matrix.h](src/led_matrix.h), contains the interface your
hardware driver will be called with.
[src/led_matrix_62x32.c](src/led_matrix_64x32.c) implements it for the 8x8 64x32
led case.  There is also a [src/led_matrix_dotstar.c](src/led_matrix_dotstar.c)
file which is used *instead* when building the dotstar version.  To add additional
hardware support, create a new `.c` file (such as
`src/led_matrix_neopixel.c` and change `CMakeLists.txt` to point to your new
file instead of `led_matrix_dotstar.c`.  The main function you'll be
implementing is:

```c
#define LED_MATRIX_WIDTH 8
#define LED_MATRIX_HEIGHT 8

// render the matrix.
// data is of the form 0xIIRRGGBB where
// II -> Intensity (brightness)
// RR -> Red
// GG -> Green
// BB -> Blue
//
// Values are 0-255
// format is horizontal rows.  The first pixel
// sent is the southwest corner of the matrix.
void led_matrix_render(uint32_t* data);
```

Again, look at [src/led_matrix_dotstar.c](src/led_matrix_dotstar.c) for a straight-forward implementation of `led_matrix_render`.

## Using Different Clock Hardware

Instead of an RTC, you might want to go with a radio-based clock, a GPS clock, or [keeping the time with the Pi Pico](https://raspberrypi.github.io/pico-sdk-doxygen/group__hardware__rtc.html).

> The PICO SDK provides time functions but you'll lose battery backup and accuracy is not as good as a real RTC.

[src/clock.h](src/clock.h) gives the interface:

```c
// gets the current time in HHMM format (0000 - 2359)
// For example, if 1354 is returned, the time is 13:54 (or
// 1:34 PM if you prefer)
uint16_t clock_get_time();

// Sets the time.  For example: time_hhmm = 1234 would set the
// time to 12:34.  Note that 24h time is always used so 1234
// is 12:34 PM and 0034 is 12:34 AM.
void clock_set_time(uint16_t time_hhmm);
```

and [src/clock_ds3231.c](src/clock_d23231.c) gives a concrete implementation for
the RTC module.  The file [src/clock_pico_internal.c](src/clock_pico_internal.c)
provides an implementation that does not need RTC hardware.  It can be selected
in [src/CMakeLists.txt](src/CMakeLists.txt).

## Adding / Changing Display Modes

There are two files and one directory to consider.  The first file is [src/clock_render.c](src/clock_render.c).  Specifically, this section:

```c
  struct DisplayMode display_modes[] = {
    {"matrix_with_numbers", matrix_with_numbers_render},  // This entry will be the default power-on mode
    {"matrix", matrix_render},
    {"bounce", bounce_render},
    {"number_cascade", number_cascade_hires_render},
    {"waveform", waveform_render},
    {"drops", drops_render},
    {"off", blank_render},  // always put this entry at the end of the list
  };
```

This section lists the display modes, names them and provides a function pointer to each one.  If you were to remove a line from this array, or reorder the lines, you would see the corresponding change when you build/load new firmware.  In order for the function pointers to have any meaning, you'll need to include the corresponding files:

```c
#include "render/matrix_with_numbers.h"
#include "render/matrix.h"
#include "render/bounce.h"
...
```

Note that, by convention, all rendering functions are defined in the [src/render](src/render) directory.  Here is an example [src/render/blank.c](src/render/blank.c):

```c
void blank_render(
    uint32_t* led,
    uint32_t frame_index,
    uint16_t time_hhmm,
    const struct ClockSettings* settings) {
  memset(
    led,
    0,
    LED_MATRIX_WIDTH * LED_MATRIX_HEIGHT * sizeof(uint32_t));
}
```

This simple function simply clears the `led` array to zero which effectively turns off the display.

The `time_hhmm` provides the time as an integer.  For example, 1:45 AM would be
represented as `0145` and 1:45 PM would be represented as `1345`.

The `frame_index` parameter can be useful for initialization.  It is always set to `0` when the display mode is made active.

The `settings` structure has several potentially-useful fields but especially useful is getting the user preference for LED brightness:

```c
  const uint8_t br = brightness_step_to_brightness(settings);
```

This value (0-255), would then be used as a baseline brightness when turning on leds in `led`

## Changing the Console

The file `src/clock_settings.c` contains all of the commands available to the
USB shell.  Adding your own is straight-forward but I suggest skimming through
https://github.com/mattwach/pico_uart_console to get up-to-speed on how the
console works first.
