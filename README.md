> "I DONâ€™T EVEN SEE THE CODE ANYMORE" - The Matrix.  

This is a clock that presents in a matrix-like format on an 8x8 RGB LED matrix.  At first you will not be able to read it but eventually the patterns will become clear.

But, given that this is an open DIY project that combines some code with an LED matrix and clock, you can mold it to include your own ideas.  It's a starting point for the clock that
you want to make.  For example maybe you want:

   * To use a different LED matrix (Different dimensions, neopixel, other types)
   * To use a different type of clock hardware (Radio based, GPS, internet, none)
   * To display the data differently (Scrolling numbers, binary clock etc).

   This project attempts to make it straight-forward to make changes like the ones described above, both in the way the code is structured and in the advice I give later in this document on how to make these types of changes in the code.

# Parts List

Here are the parts I used to build my version:

   * Microcontroller: Raspberry PI Pico
   * LED Matrix: Adafruit Dotstart 8x8
   * Clock: DS3231-based RTC module
   * Buttons: 2 12x12 pushbuttons for control, 1 6x3 SMD reset button (optional)
   * Connector: 1 4x1 JST-XR male-female pair for connecting the LED matrix
   * 1 220uF capacitor to reduce 5V noise
   * A 6x4 cm copper clad board. Only needed if you CNC or chemical etch your PCB.

# Reading the clock

Here is my scheme for showing the time.  You can change it as-you-like to create a clock that only you can read :)

Numbers are represented by colors, one of the diplay modes of the clock (explained below) will show you a table.  Here it is with the corresponding number overlayed:

TABLE

and here is a text description

| color | name            |
|-------|-----------------|
| 0     | dark red        |
| 1     | red             | 
| 2     | orange          |
| 3     | yellow          |
| 4     | green           |
| 5     | blue            |
| 6     | indigo          |
| 7     | violet          |
| 8     | dark blue       |
| 9     | white           |

> Colors are defined in [src/colors.c](src/colors.c) if you would like to edit them.

As for digits, this is represented by the speed at which the matrix points fall:

| digit               | speed  |
|---------------------|--------|
| Hour - ones place   | slow   |
| Minute - tens place | medium |
| Minute - ones place | fast   |

So given the above, here is a table of examples:

| 12h time | 24h time | Slow point | Medium Point | Fast Point |
|----------|----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 12:00 AM | 00:00    | dark red   | dark red     | dark red   |
| 12:15 AM | 00:15    | dark red   | red          | blue       |
| 1:37 PM  | 13:37    | yellow     | yellow       | violet     |
| 11:37 PM | 23:37    | yellow     | yellow       | violet     |


If you are wondering about the hour's tens place, the clock doesn't show it.  I thought it made the clock easier to read but you'll have
to know if it's morning our evening to fill in the tens yourself.  Reiterating - if you want it to work differently, there are instructions later on how to change the display.

Read the next section for various "training" modes the clock offers to help you learn to read it.

## Power On

When you first plug in the board you will get a matrix clock display that indicates the current time as-reported by the connected clock module.

## Setting the Time

The clock has two buttons.  One of them is the time set button.  If you press this once, the clock will show the
